            <description><![CDATA[<h2>Welcome…</h2>,<p>We are so glad you are here – congratulations for being open and curious enough to explore the possibility that weight loss and re-gaining health can and SHOULD be FUN! Before we begin, here’s a little bit of information…</p>,<p>In the middle of the night, Erica Salda, Host of <a href="http://www.tsr.com/" title="">TeenSportsRadio.com KZSB AM 1290</a>, was hit with an idea - <strong>Santa Barbara Wellness Center, Inc.</strong>, an education based charity focusing on our kids and seniors, increasing their understanding and participation in a “wellness culture” way of being.</p>,<p>TeenSportsRadio has been celebrating Teen wellness with sports participation for over five years now, having a strong internet presence, as well as, being aired four times a week.</p>,<p>Erica reached out to one of her Co-Hosts Dominique Hackett. After two heart attacks by the age of 50, Dominique had no choice but to take a hard look at the way she was living life. “But I’m a vegetarian!” “But I’m spiritual!” “But everyone says I am a happy and delightful person to be around!” Time to walk the talk for personal health reasons and the health of our community.</p>,<p>Erica then spoke to her many TeenSportsRadio Co-Hosts who have large studnet loan debts, but who want to serve our community. How about including their ability to accumulate non-profit employemnt hours, thus participating in the federal <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service" title="">Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program.</a></p>,<p><strong>Thus Santa Barbara Wellness Center, Inc.</strong> was born and as a celebration of our combined profound love for our community, SBWCI’s yearly board meeting are held on Valentine’s day every year.</p>,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/21ad0cfddfb256a14265afaa6c2ac47b6ba827d4.jpg">]]></description>
