## Welcome...

We are so glad you are here -- congratulations for being open and curious enough to explore the possibility that weight loss and re-gaining health can and SHOULD be FUN! Before we begin, here's a little bit of information...

In the middle of the night, Erica Salda, Host of [TeenSportsRadio.com KZSB AM 1290][0], was hit with an idea - **Santa Barbara Wellness Center, Inc.**, an education based charity focusing on our kids and seniors, increasing their understanding and participation in a "wellness culture" way of being. 

TeenSportsRadio has been celebrating Teen wellness with sports participation for over five years now, having a strong internet presence, as well as, being aired four times a week.

After two heart attacks by the age of 50, Dominique Hackett had no choice but to take a hard look at the way she was living life. "But I'm a vegetarian!" "But I'm spiritual!" "But everyone says I am a happy and delightful person to be around!" Time to walk the talk for personal health reasons and the health of our community. 

How about incorporating the ability to employee healthcare professionals who have large student loan debts, who want to serve our community and accumulate non-profit hours, thus participating in the federal [Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program.][1]

**Santa Barbara Wellness Center, Inc.** was born and as a celebration of profound love for our community, our yearly board meeting is held on Valentine's day every year.
