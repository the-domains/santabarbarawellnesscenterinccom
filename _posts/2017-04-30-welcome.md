## Welcome...

We are so glad you are here -- congratulations for being open and curious enough to explore the possibility that weight loss and re-gaining health can and SHOULD be FUN! Before we begin, here's a little bit of information...

In the middle of the night, Erica Salda, Host of [TeenSportsRadio.com KZSB AM 1290][0], was hit with an idea - **Santa Barbara Wellness Center, Inc.**, an education based charity focusing on our kids and seniors, increasing their understanding and participation in a "wellness culture" way of being.

TeenSportsRadio has been celebrating Teen wellness with sports participation for over five years now, having a strong internet presence, as well as, being aired four times a week.

Erica reached out to one of her Co-Hosts Dominique Hackett. After two heart attacks by the age of 50, Dominique had no choice but to take a hard look at the way she was living life. "But I'm a vegetarian!" "But I'm spiritual!" "But everyone says I am a happy and delightful person to be around!" Time to walk the talk for personal health reasons and the health of our community.

Erica then spoke to her many TeenSportsRadio Co-Hosts who have large studnet loan debts, but who want to serve our community. How about including their ability to accumulate non-profit employemnt hours, thus participating in the federal [Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program.][1]

**Thus Santa Barbara Wellness Center, Inc.** was born and as a celebration of our combined profound love for our community, SBWCI's yearly board meeting are held on Valentine's day every year.
